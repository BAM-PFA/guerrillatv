    <p>
      In the run-up to the <strong>2020 presidential conventions</strong> and this November's <strong>election</strong>, we will be conducting interviews with some of the core members of TVTV. They will give some insight into the process of making <strong>guerrilla television</strong> and also reflect on what has changed (and what hasn't) from the media landscape of the 1970s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keep an eye on this space as we post interviews in August and September 2020!
