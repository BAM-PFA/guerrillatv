      The TVTV collection at BAMPFA includes the <strong>unedited camera-original tapes</strong> from the majority of the collective’s works. This includes some of their earliest, groundbreaking documentaries: <strong>The World’s Largest TV Studio</strong>, which examines the 1972 Democratic National Convention; its Republican companion piece <strong>Four More Years</strong>; and <strong>Gerald Ford’s America</strong>, a two-part series following TVTV as they embed themselves into the first 100 days of the Ford presidency.

      BAMPFA <strong>digitized and preserved</strong> 437 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EIAJ-1">half-inch open reel</a> video tapes from these three works as part of a 2018 project funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities. The American public can now view <strong> over 200 hours</strong> of raw, behind the scenes footage from a pivotal moment in in our nation’s history. All the raw tapes from this project will soon on view at <a href="https://archive.org/details/@bampfa_film_library_study_center">archive.org</a>, and we’ve prepared a selection of highlights that you can stream now.
