      The TVTV collection at BAMPFA includes the edited master tapes and unedited camera originals from most of the collective’s works. This includes some of their earliest, groundbreaking documentaries: The World’s Largest TV Studio, which examines the 1972 Democratic National Convention, its Republican companion piece Four More Years; and Gerald Ford’s America, a two part series following TVTV as they embed themselves into the first 100 days of the Ford presidency.

      BAMPFA digitized 437 half-inch open reel (link to EIAJ wikipedia) video tapes from these three works as part of a 2018 project funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities. The American public can now view 200 hours of raw, behind the scenes footage from a pivotal moment in in our nation’s history. All the raw tapes from this project will soon on view at archive.org, and we’ve prepared a selection of highlights that you can stream now.
