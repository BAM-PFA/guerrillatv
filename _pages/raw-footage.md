        The TVTV collection at BAMPFA includes the unedited <strong>camera-original</strong> tapes from the majority of the collective’s works. This includes some of its earliest, groundbreaking documentaries: <a href="/raw-footage/2020-07-14_worlds-largest-tv-studio.html"><i>The World’s Largest TV Studio</i></a> (1972), which examines the 1972 Democratic National Convention; its Republican companion piece, <a href="/raw-footage/2020-07-14_four-more-years.html"><i>Four More Years</i></a> (1972); and <a href="/raw-footage/2020-07-14_gerald-fords-america.html"><i>Gerald Ford’s America</i></a> (aired 1975), a four-part series following TVTV members as they embed themselves into the first one hundred days of the Ford presidency.

        BAMPFA <strong>digitized and preserved</strong> 437 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EIAJ-1">half-inch open reel</a> videotapes from these three works as part of a multi-year project funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities. You can now view more than two hundred hours of raw, behind-the-scenes footage from a pivotal moment in in our nation’s history. All the raw tapes from this project are available on <a href="https://archive.org/details/@bampfa_film_library_study_center">archive.org</a> and we’ve also prepared a selection of highlights here.
