      Between 2008 and 2012, BAMPFA received <strong>over six thousand pages</strong> of archival paper records and hundreds of raw camera tapes and edited masters from some of the original TVTV members. The paper treasure trove included not only correspondence and insurance contracts from TVTV's five years of active production, but also fan (and hate) mail, snapshots, and scrapbooks related to several productions.

      In 2018 BAMPFA received a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities to digitize a selection of the videotapes as well as all of the papers. The paper archive is now <a href="https://digicoll.lib.berkeley.edu/search?&sf=title&so=a&rm=&p=collection%3A%27Top%20Value%20Television%20papers%27&ln=en">available online</a> through UC Berkeley Library's Digital Collections system, and a <a href="https://oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/c87m0fns/">detailed finding aid</a> to the papers is on the Online Archive of California. Find highlights from the paper collection here.
      <strong>Enjoy!</strong>
