This tape consists of approximately thirty-three minutes of raw footage from the TVTV shooting of <i>Gerald Ford's America</i> (1975).

TVTV visited Portland, Oregon, as the president arrived with a media entourage for a high-dollar fundraiser, where TVTV interviewed befurred and bejewelled gala attendees. The new president, who had only taken office three months earlier, was also greeted by a series of protests with chants of "FEED THE POOR! EAT THE RICH!" Included is a conversation at the gala with Oregon governor Tom McCall.

*__Oregon Governor Tom McCall on Gerald Ford:__ "It's a welcome change to have somebody up there—just in a person-to-person sense—who probably reminds every person who ever played football of his old high school coach. And that's a comforting image. I think that's about the way he lives his life. He's not greatly more complicated than that."*
