On the scene in Washington in the aftermath of Nixon's resignation, Skip Blumberg and Andy Mann took a break from shooting tape for TVTV's four-part series <i>Gerald Ford's America</i> (1975). In a lull between interviews with elected officials, Skip and Andy experimented with their cameras to dizzying effect.

These outtakes from <i>Gerald Ford's America</i> have been assembled to simulate the effect of a two-channel video presentation.

*__Andy Mann:__ "You're going to get dizzy before I get tired."*
