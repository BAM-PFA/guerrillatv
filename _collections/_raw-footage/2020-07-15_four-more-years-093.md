This tape consists of approximately thirty-three minutes of raw footage from the TVTV shooting of <i>Four More Years</i> (1972) at the 1972 Republican National Convention.

The TVTV crew attends a celebration for elderly Miami residents, complete with watermelons, musical performances, and speeches against Richard Nixon. Allen Ginsberg mixes with the crowd, and Ed Sanders of The Fugs sings a protest song with his autoharp. The last section of the tape includes news broadcasts taped off-air from television.
