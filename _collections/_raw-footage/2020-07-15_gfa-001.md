This tape consists of approximately 25 minutes of raw footage from the TVTV shooting of <i>Gerald Ford's America</i> (1975).

TVTV had initially planned to make a show about Richard Nixon's impeachment, but the president resigned just as the collective was gearing up for production, less than a year after vice president Spiro Agnew's resignation. The show turned into <i>Gerald Ford's America</i> as TVTV followed the accidental president's first 100 days in office. This tape is the very first from the shoot, as TVTV members arrive in Washington on the day  Nixon announced his resignation. Elon Soltes and Skip Blumberg tape the scene in front of the White House, from protests to prayer singers to bemused onlookers.

*__Unidentified onlooker at the White House :__ "I think it's better to have an honest dummy in the White House than a crook, don't you?"*
