On August 10, 2020, just days before the first of 2020's virtual presidential nominating conventions, former BAMPFA curator Steve Seid spoke with Megan Williams and Allen Rucker. Rucker and Williams were among the founding principal members of Top Value Television, and part of the TVTV crew that infiltrated the 1972 Democratic and Republican conventions to produce the guerrilla television documentaries *The World's Largest TV Studio* and *Four More Years*. The pair, who have since moved on to distinguished careers in media, steered the  conversation from the origin story of TVTV, to insider tales of the '70s video scene, to the current whereabouts and goings-on of other TVTV-ers.
