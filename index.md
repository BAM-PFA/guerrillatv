<p>Top Value Television began in 1972 when a group of mediamakers, artists, and activists used brand-new portable videotape equipment to document the <strong>'72 presidential conventions</strong>. With the sensibilities of the underground and cutting-edge consumer video tech, TVTV and the loose global network of <strong>video guerrillas</strong> spearheaded community-based news, citizen journalism, and democratized media that in 2020 continue to gain relevance.

In 1972, Shamberg, along with activist Megan Williams and Allen Rucker, a member of Stewart Brand’s Portola Institute, established the San Francisco Bay Area-based TVTV as a video production group that would use low-end video technology to create cultural and political programming notable for its unvarnished, rawly honest, and spontaneous coverage that countered the ossified and cautious coverage of corporate media. The initial spark for TVTV’s formation was a desire to document the 1972 presidential nominating conventions, both held in Miami Beach, Florida, from a point of view that the major television networks would be unable to capture. This led to TVTV’s opening salvo: the duo The World’s Largest TV Studio and Four More Years (both 1972), sardonic but serious coverage of the Democratic and Republican National Conventions. These videoworks constitute the first use of the 1/2” open reel video format ever broadcasted on national television. TVTV pioneered the movement of “do-it-yourself” television and championed the then new, radical video formats as a means of changing society, as seen in their writings and videos in our collection.
