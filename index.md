    The groundbreaking video collective <strong>Top Value Television (TVTV)</strong> began in 1972 when a group of mediamakers, artists, and activists used newly available portable videotape equipment to document the 1972 Democratic and Republican National Conventions. At a time when television news reporters were weighed down by enormous packs of expensive equipment and gear, this band of "braless, blue-jeaned video freaks," as <i>Newsweek</i> called them, set out to revolutionize not only how to capture the news, but how to reframe the daily news cycle. With the sensibilities of the underground and cutting-edge consumer video technology, TVTV and a loose global network of <strong>video guerrillas</strong> spearheaded community-based news, citizen journalism, and democratized media that continue to be relevant today, as we approach the 2020 conventions and the presidential election in November.

    This site showcases BAMPFA’s 2018–21 project to digitize the hundreds of hours of never-before-seen raw footage that was recorded for three of TVTV's broadcast documentaries. <i>Four More Years</i> (1972) follows the well-oiled Republican convention that nominated Richard Nixon and Spiro Agnew, and <i>The World's Largest TV Studio</i> (1972) documents the Democratic convention that put George McGovern and Thomas Eagleton on the ballot. <i>Gerald Ford's America</i> (1975) finds these Portapak-toting "<strong>freex</strong>" embedded in the White House during the turbulent one hundred days following Nixon's resignation.</p>

    <p>
    A treasure trove for political junkies, cultural historians, and anyone interested in how media portrays and shapes stories, the raw footage includes off-the-cuff cameos from such notables as Willie Brown, Walter Cronkite, Ron Dellums, Allen Ginsberg, Shirley MacLaine, Ralph Nader, Tricia Nixon, Dan Rather, and Gloria Steinem. As part of this project,  several thousand pages of archival papers, including scrapbooks and snapshots by TVTV, have also been digitized and made <a href="https://digicoll.lib.berkeley.edu/search?&sf=title&so=a&rm=&p=collection%3A%27Top%20Value%20Television%20papers%27&ln=en">available online</a>.

    "The use of television's tools to give voice to overlooked peoples and viewpoints was at once an activist project and an aesthetic enterprise," writes former BAMPFA Video Curator Steve Seid. "No other video collective seemed to meld these dual intentions—political poignancy and artful rendering—as expertly as TVTV."
    </p>
    <p>
    "We were inventing a <strong>new form of television</strong>," says Allen Rucker, one of TVTV's original members alongside Wendy Appel, Paul Goldsmith, Hudson Marquez, Michael Shamberg, Tom Weinberg, and Megan Williams. Inspired by Shamberg's 1971 DIY video production manual-slash-manifesto, Guerrilla Television, the collective featured dozens of members between 1972 and 1977, with crossover from other now-legendary media collectives such as Ant Farm, Raindance, and the Videofreex. Their on-air "correspondents" included such future stars as John Belushi, Christopher Guest, Bill Murray, and Harold Ramis.
    </p>
    <p>
    "TVTV’s iconoclastic coverage of the events—brash interviews with the media and politicians alike, cameraman-interviewers, stylish graphics, and no voice-overs, in sum their own video version of vérité—garnered praise from jaded journalists and hipster critics alike," writes author Deirdre Boyle. "Their <strong>experimental TV</strong> tactics proved that a new style and energy had swept away the known world of network TV news."
