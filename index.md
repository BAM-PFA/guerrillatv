    The groundbreaking video collective <strong>Top Value Television</strong> (TVTV) began in 1972 when a group of mediamakers, artists, and activists used brand-new portable videotape equipment to document the <strong>‘72 Democratic and Republican presidential conventions</strong>. At a time when TV news reporters were weighed down by enormous packs of expensive equipment and gear, this band of "braless, blue-jeaned video freaks," as <i>Newsweek</i> called them, set out to revolutionize not only how to capture the news, but how to reframe the daily news cycle. With the sensibilities of the underground and cutting-edge consumer video tech, TVTV and a loose global network of <strong>video guerrillas</strong> spearheaded community-based news, citizen journalism, and democratized media that continue to gain relevance in the run-up to the <strong>2020 presidential conventions</strong>.

    This site showcases a 2018-2021 preservation project at <a href="https://bampfa.org">BAMPFA</a> to digitize the hundreds of hours of never-before-seen raw footage that went into three of TVTV's broadcast documentaries. <strong>Four More Years</strong> follows the well-oiled Republican convention that nominated Richard Nixon and Spiro Agnew, and <strong>The World's Largest TV Studio</strong> documents the Democratic convention that put George McGovern and Thomas Eagleton on the ballot. <strong>Gerald Ford's America</strong> finds these Portapak-toting freex embedded in the White House during the turbulent 100 days following Nixon's resignation. A treasure-trove for political junkies, cultural historians, and anyone interested in how media portrays and shapes stories, the raw footage includes off-the-cuff cameos from such notables as as <strong>Allen Ginsberg</strong>, Ronald Reagan, Tricia Nixon, Willie Brown, <strong>Ralph Nader</strong>, Ron Dellums, Shirley MacLaine, <strong>Gloria Steinem</strong>, Walter Cronkite, and <strong>Dan Rather</strong>. This project has also digitized and put online several thousand pages of archival papers, including scrapbooks and snapshots by TVTV.

      "The use of television's tools to give voice to overlooked peoples and viewpoints was at once an activist project and an aesthetic enterprise," writes former BAMPFA video curator <strong>Steve Seid</strong>. "No other video collective seemed to meld these dual intentions–political poignancy and artful rendering–as expertly as TVTV."
      </p>
      <p>
      "We were inventing a new form of television," notes Allen Rucker, one of TVTV's original members alongside Michael Shamberg, Tom Weinberg, Hudson Marquez, Wendy Appel, Paul Goldsmith, and Megan Williams. Inspired by Shamberg's 1971 DIY video production manual-slash-manifesto, <strong>Guerrilla Television</strong>, the collective featured dozens of members between 1972-1977, with crossover from other now-legendary media collectives like <strong>Ant Farm</strong>, <strong>Raindance</strong>, and <strong>Videofreex</strong>. Their on-air "correspondents" included such future stars as Bill Murray, Harold Ramis, Christopher Guest, and John Belushi.
      </p>
      <p>
      "TVTV’s iconoclastic coverage of the events—brash interviews with the media and politicians alike, cameraman-interviewers, stylish graphics, and no voice-overs, in sum their own video version of <i>vérité</i>—garnered praise from jaded journalists and hipster critics alike," writes author <strong>Deirdre Boyle</strong>. "Their experimental TV tactics proved that a new style and energy had swept away the known world of network TV news."

# About Some of TVTV's Members

Between 1972 and 1977 the TVTV collective attracted and lost dozens of members, contributors, collaborators, and hangers-on. Some of these later became household names, and of the core members many went on to careers in Hollywood, academia, and the arts. Some of the core members of the group are listed here.
